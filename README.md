# PythonProjectOOPs

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It contains example scripts to help you understand and practice OOP principles.

You can run Python scripts in various environments such as Spyder, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebook. Spyder and PyCharm are full-featured IDEs that provide advanced code editing, debugging, and project management tools, while Jupyter Notebook offers an interactive, cell-based environment ideal for experimentation and data analysis. Each environment has its strengths: IDEs like PyCharm are great for larger projects and structured development, while Jupyter is excellent for quick prototyping and visualization.

For this project, I have used both PyCharm and Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate and practice OOP concepts. Additionally, I utilized the notebook generation plugin from Visual Studio Code to quickly create and manage a notebook for practice purposes.

## Project Structure

- `ExcersieOne.py`  
  Contains exercises or examples related to OOP concepts.
- `PythonProject.py`  
  Main project file or additional OOP examples.
- `PracticeNotebook.ipynb`  
  Contains practice codes for the basics of Python programming.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment and Running Jupyter Notebook

To ensure a clean and isolated Python environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   This will create a folder named `venv` in your project directory.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```
   You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

3. **Check if Jupyter Notebook is Already Installed**
   ```powershell
   jupyter --version
   ```
   If Jupyter is installed, this command will display the version number. If not, proceed to the next step to install it.

4. **Install Jupyter Notebook (if needed)**
   ```powershell
   pip install jupyter
   ```

5. **Open Jupyter Notebook**
   ```powershell
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will launch the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.

## TokensAndPasswords.txt

The `TokensAndPasswords.txt` file contains rough notes, tokens, and passwords used for accessing Jupyter notebooks in this project. Use this file to keep track of any credentials or notes related to notebook access. **Do not share this file publicly or commit it to version control to keep your credentials secure.**

## How to Run the Python Files

You can run the example scripts directly using Python:
```powershell
python ExcersieOne.py
python PythonProject.py
```

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance your understanding of OOP in Python.
